# Keepr

Keepr is a full-stack web application inspired by Pinterest that allows users to create collections (“vaults”) and save content (“keeps”) to organize and manage ideas in one place. The project was built as part of a full-stack development bootcamp to demonstrate frontend, backend, authentication, and database integration skills.
